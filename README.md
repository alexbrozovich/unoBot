# unoBot
The goal of this program is to create an Artificial Intelligence that always selects the optimal move in a game of Uno. Currently, the program can simulate a game of Uno between four computer players, but the players' moves are selected at random from a list of legal plays. I plan to use this base to simulate a ton of games and feed the data into a neural network in order for it to learn which moves are optimal. Since there is a large random component to Uno, I am curious to see how this project will turn out. 

Next Steps:
- When players are hit with a Draw 2 or Draw 4, have them skip their turn
- When a player is hit with a Draw 2 or Draw 4, allow them to play their own if they have it in their hand instead of being forced to draw cards regardless
- Implement scoring at the end of games
- Add an artifical intelligence component
